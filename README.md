# DANE TLS: DNS-Based Authentication

Use DANE to start and verify secure SMTP connections between MTAs. This mitigates an MITM-attack.

### Prerequisites

#### Inbound email:
* Your mail server [has support](#opens-a-tls-connection-to-a-mail-server) for STARTTLS.
* Your domain (and mail server domain) are using [DNSSEC](https://dnsviz.net/).

ðŸ‘‰ DANE for email that is sent to you means [publishing a DNS record](#tlsa-resource-record).

#### Outbound email:
* Your mail server has support for DANE.

ðŸ‘‰ DANE for email that you send to others means [configuring your mailserver](#configuring-mail-server).

### How DANE works:
DANE first gets the TLSA-records from the DNS. When one or more valid records are found: The mailserver will start a TLS connection. Opening that connection returns a certificate. That certificate must match one of those TLSA-records.

The domain in the MX-record is used to connect with TLS on TCP port 25.

## TLSA Resource Record 

With a TLSA record in your DNS; A sending server can verify the certificate that it receives.

In summary, you probably want to use the following pattern: DANE-EE(3), SPKI(1), SHA-256(1)
```
_25._tcp.mail.example.com. 300 IN TLSA 3 1 1 <your SHA2-256 hash>
```
Replace the value of ```<your SHA2-256 hash>``` with the [hashed value](#generate-the-sha2-256-hash-based-on-the-spki) of your own certificate.
<br> Replace ```mail.example.com``` with your own (sub)domain.
* Mailservers on the same domain (server1.mailserver.com, server2.mailserver.com) need a TLSA record for each of their subdomains.
* Mailservers on a different domain (mailserver.com, backup-server.com) both need a TLSA record in their own zone.

The DNS-record consists of the following 4 fields:

### 1. Certificate Usage
* ~~```PKIX-TA(0)```~~
* ~~```PKIX-EE(1)```~~
* ```DANE-TA(2)``` Trust Anchor â€” Root or Intermediate Certificate
* ```DANE-EE(3)``` End Entity Certificate

> Do [NOT](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7672#section-3.1.3) use PKIX-TA(0) and PKIX-EE(1). [Postfix discards](https://github.com/vdukhovni/postfix/blob/master/postfix/src/tls/tls_dane.c#L521) those records. [Exim seems to support](https://github.com/Exim/exim/blob/master/src/src/dane-openssl.c#L1108) PKIX but there is [no added security](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7671#section-4) when an application supports all four certificate usages. You only need more DNS-records and possibly run into the issue of a mail server (sending to you) [not having](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7672#section-3.1.3) that root or intermediate.

> Consider DANE-TA(2) when you are that Root or Intermediate. It makes no sense to use a public authority like Let's Encrypt (e.g: X1 or R3). If you are using Let's Encrypt, you want to use your server certificate, thus DANE-EE(3).

### 2. Selector
* ```Cert(0)``` Full Certificate
* ```SPKI(1)``` Subject Public Key Info

> TLSA Publishers employing DANE-TA(2) records SHOULD publish records with
  a selector of "Cert(0)". Otherwise SPKI(1) is recommended because it
  is compatible with raw public keys [RFC7250] and the resulting TLSA
  record needs no change across certificate renewals when issued with the same key.

### 3. Matching Type
* ~~```Full(0)```~~
* ```SHA-256(1)``` SHA2-256 hash
* ```SHA-512(2)``` SHA2-512 hash

> Always use SHA-256(1). Do [NOT](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7671#section-10.1.2) use type Full(0).
> In the future you want to use [both of these hashes](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7672#section-5).
> When SHA2-512 becomes mandatory for applications to implement (as defined in future RFCs): You would be using that mandatory algorithm(s) only.

> In summary: Use SHA-256 for now. Care about SHA-512 (and any upcoming algorithms) later.

### 4. Certificate Association Data

> Contains the value of the Certificate or Public Key. In this case the SHA2-256 hash of the Cert(0) or SPKI(1).

### Walkthrough:

#### Finds the mail servers of a domain (MX-records):
```bash
$ dig +short MX "example.com"
```
As an example we state that the command above returns the following result:
```
10 your-mail-server.com.
11 your-backup-mail-server.com.
```
In this case you want to run the openssl commands (explained below) to verify the certificates you receive (for both of these servers).
Then you want to add a TLSA record for each of these servers in their own zone.

#### Opens a TLS connection to a mail server:
```bash
$ openssl s_client -connect "your-mail-server.com:25" -starttls smtp </dev/null
```
> The command above prints the certificate that is being used.
> When using DANE-TA(2) you need to make sure that you send that Trust Anchor as well (you would be sending the full chain in stead of a single certificate). Otherwise there is no value (cfr. certificate) to compare. Therefor verification will never pass.

#### Opens a TLS connection to a mail server (with SNI):
```bash
$ openssl s_client -connect "your-mail-server.com:25" -starttls smtp -servername "mail.example.com" </dev/null
```
> When the certificate is different in the two commands above: Make sure you add a TLSA record for both certificates. Servers that do not support SNI will receive the certificate from the first openssl command (because it is the fallback certificate).

> Prefer using the hostname of the IPv4 (the reverse DNS). In this case all servers (with or without SNI) should receive the same certificate.
> You can verify this by running the two openssl commands above. In this case they must return the same certificate.

#### Generate the [SHA2-256](#3-matching-type) hash based on the [SPKI](#2-selector):
> In the openssl commands above: Most cases will return a single certificate.
> That would be your ```End Entity``` certificate ([DANE-EE](#1-certificate-usage)).
> You want to manually verify that the certificate you received is the same as the one you are using on your server.
```bash
echo $(openssl x509 -in "/path/to/cert.pem" -noout -pubkey \
| openssl pkey -pubin -outform DER \
| openssl sha256 -binary \
| hexdump -ve '/1 "%02x"')
```
In the command above, replace ```/path/to/cert.pem``` with the location of your servers end certificate.

#### Generate the [SHA2-256](#3-matching-type) hash based on the [Full Certificate](#2-selector):
> DANE-TA(2) [should](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7672#section-3.1.2) use the "Full certificate(0)" selector in stead of the "SPKI(1)". Such TLSA records are associated with the whole trust anchor certificate, not just with the trust anchor public key. Otherwise this may, for example, allow a subsidiary CA to issue a chain that violates the trust anchor's path length or name constraints.
```bash
echo $(openssl x509 -in "/path/to/ca.pem" -outform DER \
| openssl sha256 -binary \
| hexdump -ve '/1 "%02x"')
```
In the command above, replace ```/path/to/ca.pem``` with the location of your root or intermediate certificate.

### DNS-record:
The recommended: DANE-EE(3) with SPKI(1) and SHA256(1) would result in a DNS-record e.g:
```
_25._tcp.your-mail-server.com. IN TLSA 3 1 1 <sha256-hash>"
```
And optionally a DNS-record for the backup server:
```
_25._tcp.your-backup-mail-server.com. IN TLSA 3 1 1 <sha256-hash>"
```
DANE-TA(2) with FullCert(0) and SHA256(1) would result in a DNS-record:
```
_25._tcp.your-mail-server.com. IN TLSA 2 0 1 <sha256-hash>"
```
DANE-TA(2) with [Digest Algorithm Agility](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7672#section-5) would result in two DNS-records:
```
_25._tcp.your-mail-server.com. IN TLSA 2 0 1 <sha256-hash>"
_25._tcp.your-mail-server.com. IN TLSA 2 0 2 <sha512-hash>"
```
> Consider the use of Digest Algorithm Agility when SHA2-256 becomes weak.

## Configuring mail server

Email that you send, will search for the TLSA records of the receivers MX-domain. When a record is found, your server will start a TLS connection and verify the certificate it receives.

#### Finds the mail server for a domain and validates the record:

```bash
$ bash validate-dane-tlsa.sh "example.com"
```

#### Prints the suggested TLSA-record:

```bash
$ bash dane-tlsa.sh "/path/to/cert.pem"
```
